### Why hello there! I'm Monty!

How are you doing? Oh, me? Pretty good, thanks!

I'm currently working on [BotSauce](https://www.github.com/BotSauce/BotSauce), the Discord bot for the [official Vsauce3 server](https://discord.gg/Mtmmm5J), and I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. (probably shouldn't have tried to learn all of them at once but ok)

btw pronouns: he/him
