- If you're in search of a customizable Discord badge for your GitHub such as this one ![my Discord badge](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/shield/406125028065804289?style=flat), look no further! [discord-md-badge](https://github.com/ashmonty/discord-md-badge) is exactly that!

- If you'd like to pretend to be an Arch Linux user (not really sure why you'd want to but who am I to judge), check [neofetch-but-its-always-arch](https://github.com/ashmonty/neofetch-but-its-always-arch) out!
- If you'd rather make fun of my cringy tweets, you will be able to find plenty at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashmlnt)!
- Buy me a pack of skittles [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ashm)... please? No? Uh, ok. figured it'd be worth a try.
