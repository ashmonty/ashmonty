### Hi, I'm Ash!

I'm Ash, an idiot who makes stuff™:

- If you're in search of a customizable Discord badge for your GitHub such as this one ![my Discord badge](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/shield/406125028065804289?style=flat), look no further! [discord-md-badge](https://github.com/ashmonty/discord-md-badge) is exactly that!
- If you'd like to pretend to be an Arch Linux user (not really sure why you'd want to but who am I to judge), check [neofetch-but-its-always-arch](https://github.com/ashmonty/neofetch-but-its-always-arch) out!
- If you'd rather make fun of my cringy tweets, you will find plenty at my Twitter [@ashmmonty](https://twitter.com/ashmmonty)!
- I also have a cool-ass website at [ashmonty.com](https://www.ashmonty.com/). I think.
- Give me money [here](https://ko-fi.com/ashmonty)... please? No? Uh, ok. figured it'd be worth a try.

And of course, don't forget to blackmail me at [pleasedontactuallyblackmailme@ashmonty.com](mailto:pleasedontactuallyblackmailme@ashmonty.com).
