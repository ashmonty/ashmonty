<h1 align=center>Hi, I'm Ash!</h1>

I make stuff™ in JavaScript & Node.js as a hobby. Sometimes it's useful stuff, sometimes it's just random stuff made for fun... Ok tbh it's usually the latter.

Feel free to check out my stuff™ on [my website](https://ashmonty.com/) or in the [repositories tab](?tab=repositories)!
