### It's-a me, Monty!

Ciao! You've reached Monty's Github profile via a warp pipe. Using the controller is a piece of cake. Press A to jump and B to attack. Press B to read the signs, too. Use the Control Stick in the center of the controller to move Mario around. Now, head for the castle.

I'm currently working on [BotSauce](https://www.github.com/BotSauce/BotSauce), the Discord bot for the [official Vsauce3 server](https://discord.gg/Mtmmm5J), and I'm probably gonna try learning python at some point.
